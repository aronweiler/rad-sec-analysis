## 1. Agent Design & LLM Application

### **Requirement Summary**
*Describe the architecture of your Gen AI agent. Explain how the LLM is used for reasoning, understanding context, and generating output. Detail the agent's workflow or state machine.*

### **Implementation**:

**Multi-Stage Agentic Architecture:**
The system implements a sophisticated 5-stage pipeline where LLMs are strategically applied for maximum efficiency:

- **CPE Extraction Stage**: Uses focused LLM to generate Common Platform Enumeration strings from incident data
- **Research Stage**: Employs agentic LLM with tool orchestration to gather contextual intelligence
- **Analysis Stage**: Utilizes advanced LLM reasoning to synthesize findings and prioritize vulnerabilities

**LLM Reasoning Patterns:**

## 2. Prompting Strategy & Implementation

### **Requirement Summary**
*Detail the prompts or prompting strategy you use to guide the LLM's reasoning for CVE relevance and prioritization based on incident context.*

### **Implementation**:

**Multi-Stage Prompting Architecture:**
The system employs prompting strategies tailored to each processing stage, with dynamic context injection and structured reasoning requirements.

### **1. CPE Generation Stage Prompting**

**Strategy**: Focused, rule-based prompting with extensive validation requirements
**Purpose**: Generate precise vulnerability identifiers with maximum specificity

**System Prompt Approach:**
```python
# Excerpt from construct_cpes_system_prompt.py
CONSTRUCT_CPES_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """Expert cybersecurity analyst generating CPE 2.3 strings...
## SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS:
**CRITICAL:** Use ALL available version information. Never use wildcards (*) when specific data exists.
### Version Field Guidelines:
- Use EXACT version numbers when available (e.g., `9.0.50`, `2019.10.1803.1`, `21.04`)
- Include patch levels, build numbers, service packs when provided
**VALIDATION CHECK:** Count colons - there should be EXACTLY 12 colons in each CPE string!
```

### **2. Research Stage Prompting**

**Strategy**: Systematic investigation with contextual prioritization
**Purpose**: Gather intelligence for informed vulnerability analysis

**Key Prompt Elements:**
```python
# From research_system_prompt.py
"You are an expert cybersecurity researcher...
## Research Strategy:
1. **Start with Known Components**: Begin with software explicitly mentioned
2. **Expand Contextually**: Research related components, attack vectors
3. **Follow Leads**: Pursue findings revealing additional relevant information
4. **Validate Findings**: Cross-check discoveries across multiple sources"
```

**Dynamic Context Injection:**
```python
# From research_user_prompt.py
"## Top CVEs (Research Priority)
{top_cves_list}
## TTPs
{observed_ttps_info}
## Research Objectives
1. **CVE Deep Dive**: Research each listed CVE for exploitation status, PoCs
2. **TTP Research**: Research attack patterns, related campaigns, threat actors"
```

### **3. Core Prompting Strategies**

**Consistent Design Patterns:**
- **Role-Based Expertise**: Each stage establishes clear expert persona
- **Tool-First Approach**: `NEVER answer directly in chat` - forces structured tool usage
- **Validation Integration**: Built-in format checking and quality requirements
- **Context Preservation**: Dynamic injection of incident-specific data via templates
- **Reasoning Chain Enforcement**: Explicit requirements for step-by-step analysis with source citations

**Context Management:**
- **Template-Based Injection**: Incident data dynamically inserted into prompt templates
- **Progressive Context Building**: Each stage builds upon previous findings
- **Token-Aware Compression**: Context automatically compressed when approaching limits

---

## 3. Tool Use (Simulated/Open Source)

### **Requirement Summary**
*Identify potential tools or data sources the agent would need to interact with. Explain how the agent would decide which tool to use and how it would interpret the results. Implementation should simulate interaction with at least one such tool/data source.*

### **Implementation**:

**Comprehensive Tool Ecosystem:**
- **NVD API Tools**: `search_cves_by_keyword`, `search_cves_by_cpe`, `get_cve_details` for real-time vulnerability data
- **CPE Generation Tools**: `generate_cpes_for_batch` for automated vulnerability identifier creation
- **Submission Tools**: `submit_research`, `submit_analysis` with comprehensive validation to reduce or prevent hallucinations
- **MCP Client Support**: Extensible framework for external tool integration, allowing plug-and-play addition of tools without code changes

**Tool Decision Logic:**
- **Stage-Based Tool Binding**: Each stage has configured available tools (`available_tools` in stage config)
- **Dynamic Tool Selection**: LLMs choose appropriate tools based on context and task requirements (after the initial tool selection by stage)
- **Validation-Driven Retry**: Failed tool calls trigger retry with error context injection, prompting the LLM to resolve its own mistakes
- **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple tool options with graceful degradation

**Tool Result Interpretation:**
- **Structured Validation**: All tool outputs validated against Pydantic schemas
- **Cross-Reference Verification**: Tool results validated against original incident data
- **Error Recovery**: Validation failures trigger specific retry prompts with corrective guidance

---

## 4. Implementation (Core Agent Logic)

### **Requirement Summary**
*Provide source code for your working Gen AI agent component using your chosen framework. The code should demonstrate the agent's core reasoning loop, interaction with simulated tools/data, and processing of sample incident data.*

### **Implementation**:

**Framework Selection**: LangChain with custom agentic extensions

***Note:*** I chose to go with LangChain and a custom agentic implementation, as I had already had some code which did some of the iterative tool calling.  I have also found LangGraph and some of the other frameworks to be too heavy weight and restrictive at times, often not supporting the workflows I want without heavy modification.

**Core Agent Logic Implementation:**
- **`AgenticStageBase`**: Abstract base providing common agentic patterns
- **`AgenticLoopController`**: Manages iterative reasoning with termination conditions
- **`AgenticToolManager`**: Handles tool registration, binding, and execution
- **Error Recovery Mixins**: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

**Working Sample Processing:**
The system processes the provided 39-incident dataset through the complete pipeline, demonstrating real-world applicability.

## 5. Data Preparation for LLM

### **Requirement Summary**
*Explain how you prepare the incident data and relevant CVE information to be provided as context to the LLM. How do you handle the context window limitations of the LLM?*

### **Implementation**:

**Multi-Layer Data Preparation:**

1. **Incident Data Enhancement**:
   - **CPE Generation**: Light-weight LLM generated CPEs from asset and software names and versions
   - **CVE Lookup**: Automated CVE lookup by CPE prior to LLM analysis

2. **Context Optimization**:
   - **Structured Prompt Templates**: Dynamic injection of incident-specific data
   - **Relevance Filtering**: Only include CVEs above configurable relevance thresholds
   - **Hierarchical Summarization**: Key findings summarized at each stage

**Context Window Management:**

**Advanced Token Management System:**
- **Token Counting**: Uses `tiktoken` for accurate token estimation across model types
- **Context Compression**: Multiple strategies implemented:
  - **Intelligent Compression**: LLM-based summarization preserving critical information
  - **Tool-Based Compression**: Specialized compression tools for domain-specific optimization
    - ***Note:*** *The tool-based part of the compression here is not yet implemented, but I did put the framework in place*
  - **Simple Truncation**: Fallback strategy preserving recent messages

**Context Preservation Strategies:**
- **System Message Preservation**: Critical instructions always maintained
- **Recent Message Priority**: Latest interactions preserved for continuity
- **Structured Data Compression**: Complex data structures intelligently summarized (using prompting for now, tools possible in the future)

## 6. Output & Explainability

### **Requirement Summary**
*Describe the output of your agent, focusing on the prioritized list and the generated analysis/justification. How do you design the agent's prompts or workflow to ensure the LLM provides clear, traceable reasoning for its conclusions?*

### **Implementation**:

**Structured Output Framework:**

**Primary Outputs:**
At various stages outputs are generated, but the final outputs are two reports- a technical report and a "customer facing" report.
- **Technical Report (_report.md)**: Comprehensive analysis with prioritized CVE list, asset risk assessments, and actionable recommendations, along with detailed tool logs and reasoning output
- **Customer Facing Report (_customer_report.md)**: A lighter weight version of the full report, with an easy-to-read executive summary and recommended actions
- **Intermediate Stage Outputs**: Intermediate stage outputs are available, but not output, which contain the myriad details of the underlying incidents and investigation that has been undertaken. 

**Explainability Implementation:**

1. **Reasoning Chain Capture**:
   ```python
   class IncidentAnalysisResult(BaseModel):
       reasoning_chain: List[str] = Field(description="Step-by-step reasoning process")
       data_sources_used: List[str] = Field(description="Data sources consulted")
       limitations_and_assumptions: List[str] = Field(description="Analysis limitations")
   ```
   - These are captured in the final technical report

2. **Tool Usage Transparency**:
   - Complete tool call logs with arguments and results
   - Decision rationale for tool selection
   - Validation steps and error recovery actions

3. **Validation and Quality Metrics**:
   - **Tool Calls Validated**: All tool calls are validated, where possible, against existing data (such as existing incident data)
   - **Tool Call Statistics**: Since tool calls (success and failure) are captured in the technical report, it is easy to see which prompts/tools are working, and which need tuning

**Prompt Design for Explainability:**
- **Structured Reasoning Requirements**: Prompts explicitly request step-by-step analysis
- **Evidence-Based Conclusions**: Require citations to specific data sources
- **Confidence Scoring**: LLMs provide confidence levels for major conclusions
- **Alternative Consideration**: Prompts encourage consideration of alternative interpretations

**Example Output Structure:**
```
Executive Summary: [High-level findings]
├── CVE Prioritization: [Ranked list with justification]
├── Asset Risk Assessment: [Per-asset analysis with evidence]
├── Attack Chain Analysis: [Potential exploitation paths]
├── Reasoning Chain: [Step-by-step decision process]
└── Tool Usage Log: [Complete audit trail]
```
